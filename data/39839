{"id": 39839, "title": "Taka no Tsume x Johnson: Tatakae! Jokin Shitennou", "synopsis": "A collaboration between the Eagle Talon franchise and S.C. Johnson's Japanese branch. \n\nEagle Talon has a giant mold monster in their base, and a sentai group called Jokin Shitennou who look eerily like Yoshida appear to fight the mold with their cleaning superpowers (each hero is based on 1 real S.C. Johnson cleaning product). \n\nThe second episode focuses on the mold killer disinfectant push type alcohol bottle; that sentai hero shows a family just how much mold and bacteria are on the kitchen table just from wiping it with a wet rag. She then uses her product powers to eliminate the health hazard.\n", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}]}
