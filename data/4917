Tezuka Osamu crafts a love story in the time when humans are expanding into space at the end of the 21st century, employing an omnibus form similar to Bradbury's \"Martian Chronicle.\" The story line is similar to \"Phoenix: Nostalgia.\" Leaving the earth after marriage, a woman is left behind in space when her husband suddenly dies of a cosmic disease. These background details were used in \"The Phoenix\" as well. This time, her friends on the Earth head for space to save the woman who was once everyone's ideal lady. In this special animated piece, Tezuka Osamu emphasizes his basic concepts that \"love can save the earth\" and \"only love can save humans.\" \n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu.net)", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
