{"id": 1204, "title": "Kujira no Chouyaku", "synopsis": "Time has come to a standstill. A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies. What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
