{"id": 1743, "title": "Super Milk-chan", "synopsis": "Milk-chan is a girl who lives in a house stuck on the side of a building with her two sidekicks: Tetsu-ko, a paranoid robot that looks like a bottle and Hanage, a green blob with a mustache.\n\nMilk is poor and she can't pay the rent, especially after her attempt to extort a local ant family fails. However, she is saved because the president himself offers her a job (some sort of a secret mission). Milk-chan answers the phone to receive missions from The President by saying something like \"Hello, Bank of Hokkaido. Just kidding!\"\n\nAfter getting her mission, Milk-chan and her sidekicks take off aboard the \"Milk-6\" helicopter to go on her mission. Did I tell you this is a spoof of 1970s spy thrillers or some sort of Bond movies?\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
