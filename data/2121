{"id": 2121, "title": "Captain Tsubasa: Sekai Daikessen!! Jr. World Cup", "synopsis": "In the fourth movie, the classical Japan-Europe match becomes intercontinental. This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, \"All Europe\", and \"All South America\". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas \"Tiger Shot\" or Tsubasas \"Top Spin\" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}]}
