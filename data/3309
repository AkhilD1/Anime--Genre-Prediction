She is in a weak condition, living most of her life sleeping and passing the day hiding her lustful thoughts for Yujiro.\n\nAll the while the presence of a dark plot draws near. A rival family has their sights set on taking away the family's assets, especially the sweet young snatch of the beautiful Nanako. But Nanako isn't the only female member of the Takashiro's willing to pay back the family's debt - her mother is also getting in on the action in a jaw dropping display of eroticism that has the Takashiro women surrendering their bodies to a gang of carpet munching marauders. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}]}
