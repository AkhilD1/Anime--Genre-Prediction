Whether the activity is an arm wrestling contest or making pancakes together, the group of entertainment-seekers are sure to give it their all.\n\nThe club members are often joined by their friends in the Student Council, who know how to have a good time as well. While it can get a little chaotic when all eight girls get together, it sure doesn't stop them from meeting up and having fun!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 26, "name": "Girls Love"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
