One day, an Inukami named Youko came. She looked graceful, obedient, above all, beautiful. Soon he contracted with her, and she paid homage to him. However, she was a problematic Inukami that no one had been able to control.\n\nThis is a slap stick comedy of an Inukami Tamer, Keita and an Inukami, Youko.
