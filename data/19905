And moreover, their mother gets sickness at the same time. That's why Dai-Chan should enter in an orphanage for handicapped children; however, Mai really wants to take care of him by herself, so she tries to stop it. \n\nThis story is written about a love of family, close bond, and relationship between human and human.
