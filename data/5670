Five close friends \u2014 the energetic \"hime\"-prankster Noda Miki; the level-headed, cynical Nozaki Namiko; the intelligent, observant, and kind Oomichi Miyabi; the lively and mischievous tomboy Tomokane; and the curious, innocent, glasses-wearing Yamaguchi Kisaragi \u2014 attend this class with great enthusiasm, learning about the many art techniques. Every day seems to pose a new and interesting challenge, be it struggling with the latest assignment or when dealing with the daily strangeness of school life.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
