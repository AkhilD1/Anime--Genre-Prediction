A very humorous behind-the-scenes look (if \"Gall Force\" were a live-action series instead of being animated). \n\nCast and crew members run into severe and embarrassing difficulties as things do not turn out as they should; for example, Lufy totally drowns in embarrassment as she is object of a whole crowd of spectators while in the nude; the director's obsession with realistic filming causes some real high-voltage friction with Catty; and in the end, after the premiere, the girls end up in an ongoing on-stage tussle about which one is the most popular character.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}]}
