With everyone's feelings beginning to develop and overlap, will they be able to keep their bond strictly to that of a teacher and his students\u2014or will it mature into something else entirely?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}]}
