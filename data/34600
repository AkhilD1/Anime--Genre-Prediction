{"id": 34600, "title": "Nagoya Tetsudou Special Movie", "synopsis": "A short commissioned by Nagoya Railroad Co., Ltd. (abbr. Meitetsu) as part of their \"Place important feelings on places where important people wait.\" campaign. \n\nIn the short we see a woman and her fianc\u00e9 on a Nagoya Railroad train to go meet her parents. The woman laments over her youth from having fun as a child with her father on the train, to coldly ignoring him and being mean as a teenager when he comes to pick her up from the station with a spare umbrella on a rainy day. Time healed all wounds and the short ends with the both of them smiling cheerfully as they treasure each other.", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
