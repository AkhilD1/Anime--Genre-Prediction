Students and their families are frustrated with this injustice and overwhelmed with despair; it seems little can be done to save the school.\n\nTheir last glimmer of hope is a proposed match against the All-Stars University Sensha-dou team, consisting of the most talented students from all over the country. Despite Ooarai being severely outnumbered and clearly outclassed, they accept the challenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}]}
