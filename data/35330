{"id": 35330, "title": "Poputepipikku", "synopsis": "Poputepipikku turns absurdist comedy up to eleven with its pop culture references and surreal hilarity. With two bonafide high school girl protagonists\u2014the short and exceptionally quick to anger Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi\u2014they throw genres against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching goal\u2014to become a real anime.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}]}
