{"id": 36652, "title": "Piano no Mori (TV)", "synopsis": "A tranquil tale about two boys from very different upbringings. On one hand you have Kai, born as the son of a prostitute, who's been playing the abandoned piano in the forest near his home ever since he was young. And on the other you have Syuhei, practically breast-fed by the piano as the son of a family of prestigious pianists. Yet it is their common bond with the piano that eventually intertwines their paths in life.\n \n(Source: KEFI)", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Music"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}]}
