Each character is an amalgamation and condensation of traits found in a variety of people. The creators would like to see children develop tolerance and a broad-minded mental outlook that would enable them to accept each person they encounter. The concept uses the element of surprise to introduce this series of animated short stories. Each animated short focuses on one character and brings his or her strong personality trait to life. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
