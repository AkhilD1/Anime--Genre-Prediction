Consequently, a strong energy burst engulfs both Naruto and Yamato before they can escape.\n\nAs he awakens in a magnificent yet hostile kingdom, Naruto meets its young queen Saara and three Konohagakure ninjas on a top-secret mission. They reveal to him that he has time-traveled to Rouran 20 years into the past! To make matters worse, Mukade has already infiltrated the royal court, becoming the naive queen's most trusted minister under the alias Anrokuzan.\n\nJoining forces with the three ninjas, Naruto must protect Saara's life without fail to stop the villain's plans and return to the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Martial Arts"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}]}
