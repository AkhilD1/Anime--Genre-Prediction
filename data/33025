Together with the remaining members of Team Rabbits and the recently created Team Fawn, it\u2019s up to Asagi to hold the line against the most ruthless adversary yet.\n\n\n(Source: Anilist)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}]}
