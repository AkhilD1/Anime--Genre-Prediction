{"id": 38877, "title": "Get Back on the Hill", "synopsis": "This film was made based on Tanaami\u2019s fear of heights and his experience of seeing New York from the rooftop of a 50-floor apartment. Even the quotidian activity of walking across a zebra crossing becomes an abstract image observed from these heights. Using the process of color separation, the colors shift across each frame and create a surreal universe.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}]}
