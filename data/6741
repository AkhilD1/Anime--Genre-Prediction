{"id": 6741, "title": "Makai Senki Disgaea: Welcome to Netherworld", "synopsis": "A unique trailer found on both the DVDs and on the Disgaea 2 game advertising the anime. The animation for it is completely new, none is recycled from the show itself. Does a decent job of introducing the major characters and general plot, with new battle scenes and an altered plot so as to not give everything away. There's even a boom in shot at one point!", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 6, "name": "Demons"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
