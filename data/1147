Otherwise, life goes on as usual for the Masaki clan. But soon when the question of how Tenchi's mother had died is presented, the answer nearly causes a rift between Tenchi, his father and his grandfather, for which only Tenchi's future mother-in-law Rea can solve... as well as the resolution of Noike's unusual secret. \n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}]}
