An intense battle is held until the very end. Next, Seirin faces off with Kaijo in the semi finals. Cautious of Kaijo's ace, Kise, and his Perfect Copy ability, Seirin works fast and hard to take the lead. Kise hurts his leg and is benched, so Seirin thinks they now have their chance, but then Kaijo shows them exactly what they can do even without Kise.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)", "genres": [{"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}]}
