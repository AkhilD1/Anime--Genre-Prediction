Due to that incident, however, he has now vowed never to write again.\n\nThis continued on until he was forced to join the literary club by the literary club president, the 3rd year female student Amano Tooko, a beautiful girl who has a taste for eating literary works. Now he has been tasked with writing her snack every day after school.\n\n(Source: To Say Nothing of the Dog) ", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}]}
