{"id": 2345, "title": "Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji 5: Kanketsu-hen", "synopsis": "Only one episode of this was partially completed, the released version containing numerous examples of animation that is missing in-between frames. The story as such concerned the arrival of the real Chojin as he/she (a hermaphrodite) makes moves to wipe out all life on Earth.\n\nInterestingly, the setup for the show was far more heavily connected with the first two, more popular, chapters in the Urotsukidoji saga, with appearances by Nagumo and Akemi (unseen since the early episodes of Part III), and redesigned character models that more closely resembled the earlier episodes. Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "genres": [{"id": 6, "name": "Demons"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}, {"id": 14, "name": "Horror"}]}
