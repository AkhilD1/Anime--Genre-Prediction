It seems that some 11 years ago, Ataru played \"Shadow Tag\" with a young girl named Elle and won. Unfortunately, Elle was yet another Alien Princess; and on her planet, if a boy steps on a girl's shadow, they have to marry. \nWhen Elle's emissary comes to make arrangements, Lum redefines the term \"the atmosphere was electric,\" but to no avail: a force-field now protects Ataru from her high voltage love-zaps. Lum's friend Benten suggests a pre-emptive wedding, and they proceed to abduct Ataru and all of the wedding guests, and the stage is set for the shotgun wedding of all time!\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
