While she goes about her chores and prepares to become the inn's next caretaker, Okko discovers there are ghosts who live there that only she can see \u2013 not scary ghosts, but playful child ghosts who keep her company and help her feel less lonely. A sign outside says the spring welcomes all and will reject none, and this is soon put to the test as a string of new guests challenge Okko's ability to be a gracious host.
