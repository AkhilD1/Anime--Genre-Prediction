In the seemingly peaceful country of Nafrece, Margaret Burton lives a tranquil life.

As Margaret and Madlax follow the path of their destiny, they come ever closer to uncovering the truth - with no guarantee that it is a truth they can bear to learn.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}]}
