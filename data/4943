{"id": 4943, "title": "Yousei Florence", "synopsis": "A gentle and talented boy named Michael played beautiful music on his oboe, and his greatest love was to play for and tend to the flowers in the greenhouse at the school of music where he attended. Unfortunately, his gardening made him constantly late for orchestra practice and resulted in his dismissal from the school. When Michael fell asleep that same night, he was awakened by a dainty Flower Fairy named Florence, who would take him on an enchanted journey to a land where flowers came alive, treble notes were mischievous, and adventure beckoned. There, he would soon come to realize that his love of flowers and desire to become a great musician could go hand-in-hand and help him to become focused in life and discover himself. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia) ", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Music"}]}
