{"id": 36221, "title": "Plus Kouji", "synopsis": "A collaboration between Ukkari P\u00e9n\u00e9lope and Marukome for the latter's new product line of amazake, a drink made from fermented rice. Plus Kouji is based on a kouji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) enzyme which allows Marukome's product to contain 0% alcohol and be sugar-free so it is perfectly healthy for pregnant women, babies, and the eldery to drink while keeping the same taste as traditional amazake (which is normally sweet and mildly alcoholic).", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
