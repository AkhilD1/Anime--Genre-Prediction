{"id": 5984, "title": "Ristorante Paradiso", "synopsis": "When Nicoletta was a little girl, her mother, Olga, abandoned her and ran off to Rome to remarry. Now, 15 years later and a young woman, she travels to Rome with the intention of ruining her mother's life. She tracks Olga down to a restaurant called Casetta dell'Orso, but the second Nicoletta steps through its door, everything changes. It's a peculiar place staffed entirely by mature gentlemen wearing spectacles, and like their clientele, she is helpless against their wise smiles and warm voices. Before Nicoletta realizes it, her plans for vengeance start to fade, and she's swept up in the sweet romance of everyday Italian life. \n\n(Source: Right Stuf) ", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 47, "name": "Gourmet"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Josei"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
