She is practical, strong, yet darkly cynical. Instead of the tradition story, Alice is kidnapped unwillingly by a mysterious (yet somewhat bishie-looking) man with bunny ears into a place call Heartland. Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more... What should Alice do in such a world!?\n\n(Source: MU)", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}]}
