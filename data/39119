The focus of the anime was to showcase folktales from different prefectures. \n\nThe original airing only reached 18 episodes (36 stories) before stopping, the show was rebroadcast at a later date and the final 8 episodes (16 stories) were shown. The anime was family oriented and funded by the Seibu Department Store chain with a \"Seibu Family Gekijou\" subtitle on each ep, perhaps to mirror the highly successful \"Calpis Family Gekijou\" adoring the World Masterpiece Theater anime program.
