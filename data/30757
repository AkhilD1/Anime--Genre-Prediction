When he retrieves his cell phone which he had sent to a shop for repairs, he finds that a mysterious game titled \u201cMonster Strike\u201d has been installed on it. Unaware of its purpose or how it got there, Ren decides to open it, an action that will change his life forever as he finds himself suddenly attacked by a strange man.\n\nNow trapped on the roof of his school which strangely has been designated as a \"stage,\" Ren is shocked to see the man summon a realistic monster from the game, one that is more than capable of inflicting damage on a human. His only chance of getting out of this situation alive is by summoning the dragon Oragon, who tells Ren that he will crush the opposing monster for him. Unfortunately, it turns out that Oragon is a tiny dragon that is completely useless!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 11, "name": "Game"}]}
