After Taiga brings him some salty onigiri, Ryuuji realises that the true meaning of bentos is not the taste, but the feelings that are put into it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 47, "name": "Gourmet"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
