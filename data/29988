{"id": 29988, "title": "Commercial War", "synopsis": "In a mixture of cut-out and hand-drawn animation techniques, Tanaami jumbles together symbols of American consumer culture \u2013such as Coca Cola, Superman, Space Age astronauts and hamburgers\u2013 with occasional Japanese iconography, such as the squat toilet. The frenetic pace of the animation, the catchphrases and songs on the soundtrack as well as the hand-drawn CRT television monitor that occasionally frames the images makes reference to television commercials.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}]}
