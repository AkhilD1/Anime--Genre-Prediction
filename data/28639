{"id": 28639, "title": "Futon", "synopsis": "A futon, a traditional Japanese mattress, as seen by Yoriko Mizushiri, becomes the vehicle of dream fantasies combining the most pleasant sensations such as the morning coffee, the warmth of bedding and a soft rice carpet under one\u2019s feet.

With a fluid movement, the passive body will turn once again from the left to the right of the mattress to dive into the fantasies of even deeper unconsciousness a little while later.\n\n(Source: Krakow Film Festival)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Music"}]}
