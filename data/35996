{"id": 35996, "title": "Naeil-eun Pyeongbeomhae Jilgeoya", "synopsis": "A special included on Indie Anibox: Selma Danbaekjil Coffee's DVD release. It was meant to be the \"making-of\" extra of Watashi no Coffee Samurai but is an early pilot with a different story (the idea of a mechanized girl and transforming guy vs. a mechanized transforming guy and normal girl). Director Jang Hyeong-yoon stewed on this early creation for over half a decade before the original idea was re-worked again into a feature film Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso.\n\nIn the special, the girl is mechanized and fights kaijuu with her giant flying bird. The guy is a musician who confesses his feelings. When the girl runs away after his kiss (worried that her line of work may bring him danger if she reciprocated), he turns into a milk cow out of shock. They reconcile in the end.
