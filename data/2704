{"id": 2704, "title": "Kaiketsu Jouki Tanteidan", "synopsis": "The scene is Steam City, a London-ish city which represents an entire civilization run by coal and steam power. Because of steam, the city is sometimes covered in a mist. Villains take advantage of the steamy mist to hide and execute their evil plans. Only a few dare venture into what's beyond the steamy mist. They are known as the Steam Detectives: Narutaki (and his convertible all-purpose pistol), his nurse-assistant Lingling, and his Megamaton robot Gohliki.\n \n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Police"}]}
