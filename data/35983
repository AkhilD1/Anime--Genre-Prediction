While touring a nearby beach, Haruka stumbles upon some girls practicing beach volleyball and is quickly invited to join. This friendly practice game suddenly turns into a match when one of the girls, Narumi Tooi, notices Kanata approaching the court.\n                \nAlthough the two suffer a devastating defeat, Haruka finally realizes the reason for her cousin\u2019s quiet and distant behavior.
