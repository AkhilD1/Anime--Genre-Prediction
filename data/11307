{"id": 11307, "title": "Ginga Patrol PJ", "synopsis": "Once Upon a Time... Space differs from the rest of the Once Upon a Time titles in the sense that the series revolve on a dramatic content rather than an educational premise. The series still has a handful of educational information (such as an episode discussing the rings of Planet Saturn).\n\nThe series succeeds Once Upon a Time... Man. It reprises almost the entire totality of the characters of the previous series and adapts them into a science-fiction context.\n\nThe story tells about the confrontation of many big galactic powers. Among them there is the Omega Confederation, of which Earth is a member of; the military republic of Cassiop\u00e9e led by the general Le Teigneux; and a powerful supercomputer which controls an army of robots. Once Upon a Time... Space features the adventures of Pierrot (son of colonel Pierre and president Pierrette) and his friend Psi.", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}]}
