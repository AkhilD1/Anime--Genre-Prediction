{"id": 9279, "title": "Bara no Hana to Joe", "synopsis": "It's a Sanrio picture that feels partly like an anime art film and partly like a Warner Bros. cartoon. The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected.\n\n(Source: animenation.net)", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
