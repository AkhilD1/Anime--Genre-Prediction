Each episode consisted of a King Kong story, a Tom of T.H.U.M.B., then another King Kong story. \n\nTom of T.H.U.M.B. is a gag cartoon about a secret agent and his oriental sidekick. Animage Pocket Data Notes credits MORI Yasuji and KANISHI Takao as either character designers or animation directors of the latter, differing from the credits for the King Kong portion of the show. \n\nThis was the first cartoon TV series animated entirely in Japan expressly for American television. American sources state Rankin-Bass commissioned the work from Videocraft International; Japanese sources state it was produced by Videocraft/Toei Doga.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}]}
