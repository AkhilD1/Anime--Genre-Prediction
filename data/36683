Fushisha no Ou had a smiling Shalltear but the Shikoku no Eiyuu one showed her sneering). Due to the minimal changes between the two, resulting in only a few seconds of alternative footage, MAL will reflect it as a single episode as the blunt majority was identical.", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}]}
