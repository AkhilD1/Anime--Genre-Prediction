Many years later, when both theories are considered to be nonsense, a Mars expedition discovers a stone with the inscription \"Scientific Boys Club 1954\".\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}]}
