{"id": 1984, "title": "Memory", "synopsis": "This is a short, privately produced animated film. While elucidating the mystery and fuzziness as well as merits and demerits of memory in idealizing reality, the story develops into a tale of destruction of human beings, turning the existence of the earth into a memory of the universe. The production, only 5 minutes long, greatly helps expand the viewer's imagination, embodying the enchantment of animation.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}]}
