They manage to defeat their enemy by sheer determination, but in the aftermath of the battle, the three decide to fix their teamwork issues and improve their combat capabilities.\n\nBut as more enemies appear\u2014and requiring even more power to defeat their nemeses\u2014the girls may find themselves irreversibly changed by the use of their magic.
