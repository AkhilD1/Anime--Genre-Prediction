Shii-chan is the more serious while Mai-chan is more fun-loving. In reality, the two sisters are powerful exorcists from the Karura temple. Each wields half the power... Shii-chan can \"see\" the spirits, and Mai-chan can banish them. This is a spooky series with heavy emphasis on traditionally Japanese occult themes. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "genres": [{"id": 14, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}]}
