Following this development, the Soviet Security Force (SSF) was formed to establish humanity's presence throughout the galaxy. Among the SSF's many divisions is the Special Armored Company (SAC) #101. Using powerful mobile humanoid weapons called \"Armored Knights,\" these female enforcers dispense justice upon corrupt officials, crime lords, and other villainous forces threatening public order.\n\nSoukou Kijo Iris follows Iris Rebel, a lieutenant of SAC #101, as her squad investigates reports of trafficking activities on the planet Left. After her Elven partner Mei Li Naceri suddenly goes missing in action, Iris narrowly escapes an ambush and loses consciousness. After being captured by Orcs and taken to an underground slave auction, she is thoroughly humiliated by gleeful bidders before being sold off for an exorbitant price to Bozuk, owner of the most renowned brothel in Dark Town. Now forced into a life of prostitution, Iris must attempt to seek out her partner before the pleasures brought by her clients drive her to the brink of insanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}]}
