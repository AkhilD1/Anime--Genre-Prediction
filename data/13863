In order to be more efficient in her studies, Shiki has used neural-linked nanomachines to upload her consciousness onto a computer and is storing her physical body in a \"body pool.\" While shocked, Remu is supportive of his sister's decision, until the disaster known as the \"Early Rapture\" happens.\n\nThe Early Rapture causes everyone who has uploaded their consciousnesses to either fall into a coma or perish. Remu visits his sister's empty apartment one last time, but is shocked when Shiki arrives at the door. With no memory of her family or past, and being pursued by a violent group of researchers, Shiki and her brother are forced to flee using her newfound power of nanomachine manipulation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Suspense"}]}
