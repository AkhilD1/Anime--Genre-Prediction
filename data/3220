The Lord's wife offers an alternative: Jeanne must become the Lord's conquest for the night in a ritual deflowering.\n\nScarred by the experience, the shaken Jeanne receives no sympathy from her husband. Instead, she is neglected. But as Jeanne drifts off to sleep, she is met by a strange spirit that encourages her to deliver retribution to those who wronged her. And with a mysterious surge of pleasure and an unquenching libido, Jeanne agrees.\n\nKanashimi no Belladonna is a captivating, psychosexual adventure that tells a story of cunning witchcraft and deceitful superstition in a poor, rural village of medieval France.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}]}
