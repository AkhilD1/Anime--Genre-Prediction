Despite their reunion, their relationship isn't the same as it was years ago.\n\nAs soon as Fumi starts attending school, popular senior Yasuko Sugimoto takes notice of her and flatters her more than any other underclassmen. After running to Akira for help so many times before, Fumi must figure out who she is as a person instead of standing in someone else\u2019s shadow.  However, that doesn\u2019t stop Akira from wanting her friendship with Fumi to be as it once was. Will the girls be able to conquer the high school stage of growing up before it pulls them apart?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "genres": [{"id": 26, "name": "Girls Love"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
