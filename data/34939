{"id": 34939, "title": "Tales of the Rays", "synopsis": "Includes an animated promotional/opening video for the iOS/Android game Tales of the Rays and the main promotional video. Bandai Namco announced it was a sequel to Tales of the Rays and streamed the video on their official YouTube channel.\n\nThe game and videos star new characters Ickx Neve and Mileena Weiss along with a cast of returning characters from other Tales of games.\n\nIn a nontraditional manner, no new game app will be created, rather the current game app will receive a massive update and discontinue the main story line and start anew (several years later in-story) resetting the game play for all users. The story is said to take a darker tone.\n\nThe game's production was announced in 2015 and the official launch is expected some time later this year.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 11, "name": "Game"}]}
