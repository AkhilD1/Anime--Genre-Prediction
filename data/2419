She's got a Mad Scientist named Breckenridge living upstairs who is chronically late with the rent, and she's pining for Jim, a handsome watchmaker's apprentice whom she mistakenly believes is pursuing the local flower girl.\n\nBut this isn't our world. It is a world that has the Spirit of Wonder, where every so often, just occasionally mind you, amazing things happen.
