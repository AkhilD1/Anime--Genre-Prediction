These meteorites brought a new form of matter known as M\u00f6bius Dust to Earth. The dust permeated Earth's atmosphere, leading to a miracle. The day the meteorites fell, nicknamed \"2.29,\" accelerated the economic disparity in Japan.\n\nBefore long, the Bloody War Alliance, discontent with this disparity, began committing acts of terrorism. Amidst all this, the police established the anti-RC special mobile unit and a joint anti-RC training school for the initial training of the unit members.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 11, "name": "Game"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
