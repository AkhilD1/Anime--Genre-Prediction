{"id": 11079, "title": "Kill Me Baby", "synopsis": "Kill Me Baby is the touching story of Yasuna, a normal (?) high school girl, and Sonya, her best friend who happens to be an assassin. Unfortunately, little Sonya's trained assassin instincts often work against her and others in her daily high school life, as Yasuna's often-broken wrist can attest to. She just wanted a hug, but she ended up with a broken neck. Isn't it sad? No, it's hilarious.\n\nNot even Yasuna's intense ninja training can prepare her for the exciting adventures in this explosive 4-panel manga adaptation.", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}]}
