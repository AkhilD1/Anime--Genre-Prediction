After losing badly to the Eagles, many of the players leave, and the team now has only eight players, one too few to play a game. \n\nGoing against his principles, the main character Harumaki Shunpei decides to buy a baseball robot. However, since he does not have enough money, he ends up buying the maid robot named Azusa. Even though Azusa has a warm heart and strong determination, it doesn't appear that she stands a chance against her adversaries who were top-of-the-line baseball robots. The team's only hope seems to lie in a secret buried within Azusa's clouded past.", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}]}
