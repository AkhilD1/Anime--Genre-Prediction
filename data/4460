{"id": 4460, "title": "Kikumana", "synopsis": "This work \"Kikumana\" is an animation of a girl called Kikumana who acts like in a stage performance, the role defeated by such an ill circumstance though she tries to find herself. The primal aim is to get the audience feeling a strange atmosphere spread from this work. The image has a pictorial atmosphere and a documentary touch at the same time. Unrealistic phenomena take place there.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}]}
