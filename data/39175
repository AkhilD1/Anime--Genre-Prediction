They meet in a mundane suburban shopping mall in a provincial city.\n\nCherry always wears headphones and puts the feelings he cannot utter into his hobby, Japanese haiku poems. Smile always wears a mask to conceal her large front teeth, for which she has dental braces. As a popular video star, she streams a video about seeking \"cuteness.\"\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 19, "name": "Music"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
