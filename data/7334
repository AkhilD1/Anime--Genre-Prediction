Initially designed to help practice and enhance Bakugan skills, it quickly became a meeting place for many enthusiasts. During one of Danma Kuusou's duels, the Interspace crashes, and he gets knocked out cold. Before regaining consciousness, he experiences a vision of Bakugan at war with each other once again.\n\nThe explosion of energy that accompanied Danma's fight and caused the shutdown of the system sends shock waves across the galaxy, attracting the attention of the Twelve Orders, a Gundalian organization. They infiltrate Bakugan Interspace, looking for strong brawlers to join them in their upcoming war with another alien race, the Neathians.\n\nDanma and his companions\u2014Shun Kazami and Chouji Marukura\u2014soon find themselves caught up in an extraterrestrial war. However, distant as it may seem, the conflict threatens the very sovereignty of Earth and the future of the Bakugan race as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 11, "name": "Game"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}]}
