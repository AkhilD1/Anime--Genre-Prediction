He also wears a bright green T-shirt with a giant letter \"P\" on it, but this is supposed to be nicely inconspicuous. Momentarily forgetting to keep quiet, Potomas speaks to a child he has just saved from drowning. Rumors soon spread about a talking hippo, and Potomas is forced to go on the run.", "genres": [{"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}]}
