{"id": 29715, "title": "Nar Doma", "synopsis": "The \"unorthodox hard surreal gag\" comedy centers around the narcissistic (narushi na) Hagito and the masochistic (domazo na) Kei. Together they are \"Nar Doma.\"\n\nHagito is a handsome yet pitiful man with a loli complex. Anytime, anywhere, a mirror is his constant companion. Surrounding him are a host of highly idiosyncratic characters: the diehard masochist Kei, the unnaturally strong yet girlish Totono, the exceedingly stylish working stiff Saitou, and the extraordinarily negative Roku. Even the one normal guy has his own issues.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}]}
