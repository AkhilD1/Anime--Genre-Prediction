Kyouya \"Kyoro\" Shinomiya recently joined and became the sole male member of the five-person club.\n\nBesides Kyoro, there is Mao Amatsuka, the club president who has a tendency to bite Kyoro when she gets mad or bashful; Megumi Amatsuka, Mao's composed younger sister who always makes tea and desserts for the club's members; Shion Sumeragi, a demure chess prodigy; and Kirara Bernstein, a meat lover with a strong feline personality. All four girls have some form of interest in Kyoro.\n\nWith the girls' idiosyncratic and cute personalities, Kyoro's time in GJ-bu will never be a dull one, for better or for worse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}]}
