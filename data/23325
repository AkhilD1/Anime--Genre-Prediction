The fortress of the Great Wall has remained firmly closed, but when it creaks open, the complexion of the war starts to change dramatically.\n\nA new recruit, Susumu Tokimune, is waiting for his first battle. He takes the lead without thinking of the possibility of being trapped, and has a fatal encounter with engineer Jamie Hazaford and the Silver Trailkrieger, Argevollen.\n\nThe encounter takes place in a corner of the world where fighting has become the norm. This small coincidence is going to change the future of Tokimune's Independent 8th platoon, as well as the course of the war.\n\n(Source: Showgate)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}]}
