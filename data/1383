{"id": 1383, "title": "Yuuwaku Countdown", "synopsis": "From famed adult comic artist Hiroyuki Utatane come six of the most erotic, the most exotic, the most unusual and just downright odd stories ever animated.\n\nIn Alimony Hunter we see Jun in an extremely unusual three-for-all in which not everyone is what he (or she!) seems. She also makes an appearance as a teacher in Cherry Lips (under an alias). It all comes to conclusion in Virgin Road, there perhaps too-willing bride is having a last minute fling with her in the back room of the chapel; the groom is also not a stranger to Jun...\n\nThen there's a manly knight who discovers the joys of bondage at the hands of a fair maiden; and a Samurai policewoman forced to tackle a giant walking statue, controlled by a sex-crazed megalomaniac, before it destroys Tokyo.\nCrimson is a bloody story of a man and his blind love slave.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}, {"id": 14, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}]}
